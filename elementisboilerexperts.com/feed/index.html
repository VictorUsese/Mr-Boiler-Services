										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know, it doesn't get much more exciting than talking about 2 port valve heads but try and calm yourself before this gets out of control... but what on earth has happened to Honeywell 2 ports?? They were the original and best 2 ports but the quality has fallen off a cliff.</p>
<p>I'm not the only one to notice this as i put a post on a facebook group and everyone agreed they 'aint what they used to be. I've heard they were originally made in Canada and now in Hungary and the quality has dropped massively.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-laptop-1200 wp-image-1353" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/heating-engineer-Colchester-1-1024x1365.jpg" alt="heating engineer colchester (1)" width="1024" height="1365" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/heating-engineer-Colchester-1-1024x1365.jpg 1024w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/heating-engineer-Colchester-1-480x640.jpg 480w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/heating-engineer-Colchester-1-992x1323.jpg 992w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/heating-engineer-Colchester-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Who do we use for our central heating parts?</h2>
<p>We've been using EPH controls for quite a few years now because they're better quality, cheaper and easier to change plus if it's an electrical fault and the valve body moves freely you can change just the head which can be purchased separately from EPH unlike other brands where you need to buy the whole body as well.</p>
<p>You might have read to this point and started thinking what on earth is this mystical 2 port valve you speak of? Basically they were invented so you could have independent control over your heating and hotwater, if you choose hot water the valve for it will automatically open and the heating will stay closed and vise versa or they can both be on at the same time. This wasn't a thing before and we kind of take it for granted but it's a great invention as you are only heating what you need, either heating or hotwater.</p>
<p>Anyway we always keep a stock on the van of common central heating parts such as 2 ports, 2 port heads, programmers, central heating pumps, 3 ports etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were contacted by Henry in Wivenhoe regarding changing his old non condensing boiler and his boiler mate 2000 system. Apparently his boiler mate was the last one left on the estate as every other one had leaked through the ceiling, something that had happened here but had been repaired in the past.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-laptop-1200 wp-image-1334" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate-1024x1365.jpg" alt="gledhill boiler mate" width="1024" height="1365" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate-1024x1365.jpg 1024w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate-480x640.jpg 480w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate-992x1323.jpg 992w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>So what is a boiler mate and how does it work?</h2>
<p>So where an unvented cylinder is filled with the water that comes out of your taps a boiler mate is filled with central heating water and a separate heat exchanger like a combi boiler heats the mains water for your taps instantly. The issue with this is when it was first installed or if any work has been carried out I can guarantee not enough inhibitor has been added to the system as usually only enough is needed for the radiators and pipework but with this type of system you need enough inhibitor for a huge cylinder of heating water.</p>
<p>The lack of inhibitor causes blockages and corrosion throughout the heating system. There is another issue with this system and that is there are 3 pumps when a traditional system only has 1, this is just more things to fail and if the circuit board goes they're expensive. Gledhill used to offer a fixed price repair but not in Essex anymore. The best thing do with this system is rip it out and put a normal unvented cylinder in like we have.</p>
<h2>Benefits of an unvented cylinder, condensing boiler and smart controls</h2>
<h3>Unvented cylinder</h3>
<p>The great thing about unvented cylinders is you have good water pressure from all of your taps (presuming the correct pressure and flow tests have been done on the property prior to the installation)</p>
<p>You have a back up supply of hot water if there is a fault on the boiler, presuming you have a electrical spur and connection to the immersion heater.</p>
<p>You can have a constant supply of hot water, they come in all shapes and sized to suit the property and the needs of the property as with a vented cylinder they're quite limited in their size. I personally run my unvented cylinder on continuous so whenever hot water is used the boiler will quickly heat the cylinder up.</p>
<p>Unvented cylinders are very well insulated so lose very little heat so keeping them heating on a continuous program is the same price as heating it on a timer and you have the added benefit of always having enough hot water.</p>
<h3>Condensing gas boiler</h3>
<p>A condensing boiler saves a lot of money on your gas bills compared to a non-condensing boiler, the main way it does this is by reusing the flue heat. Instead of throwing all of the latent heat into the air it uses the heat to heat the return pipework inside the boiler. To prove the point i've tried putting my hand near the flue of a non-condensing boiler, you can't get near it it's so hot but with a condensing boiler you can easy put your hand and keep it there.</p>
<p>The minimal age for a non-condensing boiler is 18 years old, it's definitely seen better days and it's costing a fortune to run, most boilers we sell come with a 10 year warranty so as long as you keep it serviced that boiler will be worry free for a minimal of 10 years and if looked after such as getting a strip down service every 5 years you could get 15-20 years out of a good quality one such as the ideal logic max. To keep your boiler serviced please <a href="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/boiler-service-colchester/">click here</a></p>
<p>Super quiet, one of the biggest complements we get about installing a new boiler is how quiet it is, compared to the old one which crashed and banged, you have to open to cupboard to check to see if it's even running or not.</p>
<h3>Smart controls such as hive, nest, tado</h3>
<p>Henry asked us to install a hive as part of the installation, this was nice and simple as all of the old electrics had come out and the only wire I needed to reuse was for the boiler. The new cylinder is what we call a pre plumbed so all the wiring was pre connected into the wiring centre so all that was required from me was a 3 core wire into the wiring centre, 5 core into the hive receiver and then connect the receiver to the cylinder controls, I wish every job was this simple!</p>
<p>Control from the programmer (customer decided to put this onto a stand to keep it mobile) or control from your phone, you can have multiple users but no arguing now, we can help with your heating and hot water needs but domestic arguments is not our forte.</p>
<p>Having the benefit of internet control, a nice bright easy to read display and the fact a smart control will talk efficiently to your new boiler it's a win win and a great investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're like most people, you're always looking for ways to save money. Your energy bills are no exception. There are a number of simple things you can do to cut down on your energy usage and lower your bills. Read on for some tips.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the temperature outside begins to drop, so do our energy bills. This is especially true in the United Kingdom, where heating costs can be quite high. There are some simple ways, however, that you can save money on your heating bills without making any major changes or sacrifices. By following a few of these tips, you can keep your home warm and comfortable all winter long without breaking the bank.</span></p>
<h2><b>Save money and stay comfortable by programming your boiler.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a boiler in your home, did you know that you can programme it to operate at different times of the day? This can be really useful in maximising comfort and saving money on your energy bills.  For example, if you know you're going to be out of the house during the day, you can program your boiler to only operate while you're home. This way, you're not heating an empty house and wasting energy.</span></p>
<h2><b>Turn down the thermostat on your boiler.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might not realise  it, but your boiler uses a lot of energy. In fact, it's one of the biggest energy users in your home. Turning down the thermostat can save you money on your energy bills and help to prolong the life of your boiler.</span></p>
<h2><b>Use a smart meter to more easily identify where you're using the most energy.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're looking to cut down on your energy usage, a smart meter can be a helpful tool. By tracking your energy consumption, you can identify areas where you could make changes to save money. In this Article post, we'll explore how to use a smart meter to help understand where you're using the most energy. We'll also provide some tips on how to reduce your overall energy consumption. </span></p>
<h2><b>Invest in energy-efficient appliances.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to reduce your energy usage is to invest in energy-efficient appliances. This is because they use less energy to operate, which can save you money on your energy bills. In this Article post, we'll take a look at some of the most energy-efficient appliances available on the market today. We'll also provide some tips on how to choose the right appliance for your home and how to use them efficiently.</span></p>
<h2><b>Use thermostat valves on your radiators to control the temperature in each room.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're looking for a way to control the temperature in each room of your home individually, thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs) are a great option. TRVs can be installed on your existing radiators, and they work by regulating the flow of hot water through the radiator based on the current room temperature. This means that you can set each room to the temperature that you want, without having to worry about overheating or wasting energy. Plus, TRVs can help improve your home's overall energy efficiency. Here's everything you need to know about using TRVs to control the temperature in your home.</span></p>
<h2><b>Make sure you have Insulation to ensure that no energy is lost.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Energy Saving Trust, insulating your water tank, pipes and radiators could save you around £25 a year on your energy bills. This is because heat is lost through uninsulated surfaces, which means that your boiler has to work harder to maintain the same temperature. In addition, insulating your pipes can help to prevent them from freezing in cold weather.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insulating your water tank is also a good idea if it is located in an unheated area, such as an attic or garage. In order to insulate your water tank, you will need to purchase a water tank jacket. These are available from most hardware stores. For radiators, you can either purchase radiator covers or lengths of foam insulation. Make sure to measure the width and height of your radiator before purchasing covers. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, for pipes, you can use lengths of lagging pipe insulation. Simply cut the lagging to size and then fit it around the pipe. Lagging can be held in place with tape or wire ties. Insulating your water tank, pipes and radiators is a simple and effective way to reduce your energy consumption and save money on your energy bills.</span></p>
<h2><b>Keeping your boiler on, even if you're away</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when you're away from home, it's important to keep your boiler on. While it may seem like a waste of energy, there are actually several benefits to doing so. First of all, keeping the boiler on helps to prevent freezing pipes. If the temperature in your home drops too low, the water in your pipes can start to freeze, which can lead to costly repairs. Additionally, keeping the boiler on helps to keep your home warm and dry, which can deter pests from taking up residence. Finally, maintaining a consistent temperature in your home can help to prolong the lifespan of your boiler. So even when you're not at home, it's important to keep the boiler on - it could save you time and money in the long run.</span></p>
<h2><b>Make sure you have the right boiler for your house.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many options available, it's important to choose the right boiler for your home. The type of boiler you select will affect your running costs, so it's important to compare different models before making a decision. You should also consider the size of your home and the number of people who live there. A smaller home with only one or two occupants will require a different boiler than a large home with multiple occupants. By selecting the right boiler for your home, you can save money on your energy bills and enjoy reliable heat and hot water.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what can you do to save money on your heating this winter? Here are a few simple tips that should help you reduce your energy bills without too much effort. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your home well insulated, make sure your windows and doors are properly sealed, and use draft excluders around the edges of your doors. You can also save money by turning down the thermostat a degree or two – most people don’t need their homes to be as warm as they think they do. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, try to cook meals using the oven or stove instead of the microwave whenever possible – microwaves use more energy than conventional ovens. Follow these tips and you should see a noticeable difference in your next energy bill.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were contacted by Mrs Woods regarding her old glowworm boiler that had become unreliable, we gave the boiler a diagnostics and found multiple faults on the boiler that was 15 years old. This is the sort of age where a boiler starts to fail and you have to weigh up the options of a repair or replacement because you may repair one or two parts of the boiler but there is nothing to say another part will fail in the near future. The fact there was multiple parts starting to fail and that Mrs Woods was refurbing the whole house now was a perfect time to replace the boiler.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester.jpg" alt="boiler replacement colchester" width="1080" height="1440" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester.jpg 1080w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester-480x640.jpg 480w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester-992x1323.jpg 992w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester-1024x1365.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2>Which combi boiler to go for?</h2>
<p>We spoke about the different options of boiler, all of them were combi boilers but with different warranties. Mrs Woods decided on the ever popular ideal logic max2 with 10 year warranty. This is a great solid boiler which I have in my own home and would replace it with the same boiler when it eventually fails. We upgraded the system controls with nice and simple to use EPH combi pack 4 with big nice visual temperature readings. We install ideal boilers for their reliability, ease of repair and ease of servicing. With regards to servicing most manufactures of  boilers require a strip down service every 5 years, this involves removing the top of the heat exchanger and pouring water through to clear any stuck carbon, the great thing with the logic is when you do this you don't need to replace gaskets etc so works out much cheaper to service than other brands where they require new seals and electrodes &amp; flame rectification probes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-colchester-1.jpg" alt="boiler replacement colchester 1" width="1080" height="1440" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-colchester-1.jpg 1080w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-colchester-1-480x640.jpg 480w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-colchester-1-992x1323.jpg 992w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-colchester-1-1024x1365.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fitting the new boiler</h2>
<p>A straight boiler swap is the most simple type of boiler job we do. The old system was already pressurised for hot water and heating because we were replacing a combi to combi so we knew the old pipework was sound. We drained the old heating down, isolated the mains water supply and safely isolated the electricity supply. When then tested the gas and removed the meter for safety. As you can see from the above picture Rhys hung the old boiler (my old back isn't what it used to be so I avoid the heavy lifting these days) and we started to pipe it up. The ideal logic max2 comes with a brass system filter to collect any sludge in the system. We checked the water quality and it was clean so all that was required was a cold mains flush and a new bottle of inhibitor.</p>

<h3>Registering the new boiler with gas safe</h3>
<p>We commissioned the new boiler and registered with gas safe and ideal. A safety certificate will be delivered within a few days. Nothing will be sent from ideal boilers but it will be on their system and if a warranty call is ever needed please visit this page https://idealheating.com/support/faqs/warranties</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So we've recently been contacted from an existing customer about her 1 year old boiler. We've been asked to service the boiler and sort out all the issues in the system left by another heating company. So a little back story to this, we quoted against another heating company this time last year and unfortunately the other company won the quote. Like any job we don't win (can't win them all right) we call the customer to ask why they didn't get their heating work done by us so we can improve our service and offer in the future. We were told we were great but it just came down to cost as the other company were cheaper, fair enough some people are on tight budgets and go with their second or third choice purely based on cost but the point of this post is low cost doesn't always equate to value for money.</p>
<h2>A little was saved but more was lost on the heating upgrade</h2>
<p>Sometimes (more than times than not) it's best to pay a little more to get a company that has a great reputation because now the customer has asked us to go back to put right the cheaper companies wrongs because they're refusing to answer the phone and the website is down which makes us think the company has now gone bust. So even tho a little was saved at the beginning over all it will probably cost more than going with us to begin with. There's always someone out there that will take cash or ask the customer to buy the materials so they can stay under the vat threshold, this screams unprofessional to me and you have no real guarantee with the installation. We never take cash, we pay all our taxes such as vat, corporation tax, personal tax and at times it feels we're being screwed by the government but firstly I live my live with integrity and so naturally my business is a copy of me and secondly I like to sleep at night knowing i'm not a letter away from legal battle with HMRC because i've avoided tax, trust me we pay <em>TOO</em> much.</p>
<h2>Why our existing customers rarely shop on price when buying a replacement boiler</h2>
<p>We use a few different sites to get our boiler leads but none are better than our existing customers because they know how we operate, they know if there was ever an issue with something we've done we would be back around in an instant to sort it (it's life, not everything is perfect 100% of the time but it's how you react is what's important) and they won't waste their time shopping around for the cheapest as they understand they already have the best and when on the rare occasion they have gone with someone else like this job it's come back to bite them. Looking back they probably wish they went with us to begin with but they didn't and I could get on my high horse and say "well we don't like putting other peoples work right after you chose them over us" but you know what I like the customer and it was a genuine reason to go with them but as it's proved cheap doesn't always mean value.</p>
<h3>How to book a boiler quote in person or a online instant boiler quote</h3>
<p>If you're interested in using a company that's here for the long run (not like 5 minutes Joe above who has probably installed many heating systems incorrectly but isn't around anymore to put it right) please call us on 01206 912068 or </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Deciding whether to keep or replace an old gas boiler depends on several factors. Here are some reasons you might consider keeping your old gas boiler:</p>
<h3 class="p1">Boiler Cost:</h3>
<p class="p1">If your current boiler is still functioning efficiently and doesn't require frequent repairs, it may be more cost-effective to continue using it rather than investing in a new one. New boilers can be expensive, and the upfront cost might not be justifiable if your current system is working well.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Compatibility:</h3>
<p class="p1">Replacing a boiler often requires modifications to the heating system, such as changes to pipes, radiators, or controls. If your current system is compatible with modern boilers and meets your heating needs adequately, there may be no urgent need to upgrade.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Environmental impact:</h3>
<p class="p1">While newer boilers tend to be more energy-efficient and eco-friendly, replacing a working boiler contributes to the carbon footprint associated with manufacturing and disposing of the old unit. If your old boiler is still relatively efficient and not causing excessive emissions, keeping it for now might be a greener choice.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Limited boiler alternatives:</h3>
<p class="p1">Depending on your location, there might be limited options for alternative heating systems or fuel sources. If gas is readily available and cost-effective in your area, sticking with a gas boiler could be a practical choice.</p>
<p class="p1">However, it's important to consider some potential drawbacks of keeping an old gas boiler:</p>
<h3 class="p1">Energy efficiency:</h3>
<p class="p1">Older boilers may have lower energy efficiency ratings compared to newer models. Upgrading to a high-efficiency boiler could lead to reduced energy consumption and lower utility bills over time.</p>
<p class="p1">Reliability and safety: As boilers age, their reliability can decrease, leading to more frequent breakdowns and potential safety hazards. Older boilers might also lack modern safety features present in newer models.</p>
<h3 class="p1">Maintenance and repair costs:</h3>
<p class="p1">While your current boiler might be working fine now, older units are more likely to require repairs and maintenance in the future. Consider the potential costs of ongoing servicing and repairs when evaluating the long-term viability of your old boiler.</p>
<p class="p1">Ultimately, the decision to keep or replace your gas boiler should be based on a thorough evaluation of its efficiency, reliability, safety, and long-term costs. It may be helpful to consult with a qualified heating professional who can assess your specific situation and provide personalised recommendations. If you would like to discuss if replacing your old boiler is the right thing to do please do so <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/contact-us/">here</a></span></p>
