										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were contacted by Henry in Wivenhoe regarding changing his old non condensing boiler and his boiler mate 2000 system. Apparently his boiler mate was the last one left on the estate as every other one had leaked through the ceiling, something that had happened here but had been repaired in the past.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-laptop-1200 wp-image-1334" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate-1024x1365.jpg" alt="gledhill boiler mate" width="1024" height="1365" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate-1024x1365.jpg 1024w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate-480x640.jpg 480w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate-992x1323.jpg 992w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gledhill-boiler-mate.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>So what is a boiler mate and how does it work?</h2>
<p>So where an unvented cylinder is filled with the water that comes out of your taps a boiler mate is filled with central heating water and a separate heat exchanger like a combi boiler heats the mains water for your taps instantly. The issue with this is when it was first installed or if any work has been carried out I can guarantee not enough inhibitor has been added to the system as usually only enough is needed for the radiators and pipework but with this type of system you need enough inhibitor for a huge cylinder of heating water.</p>
<p>The lack of inhibitor causes blockages and corrosion throughout the heating system. There is another issue with this system and that is there are 3 pumps when a traditional system only has 1, this is just more things to fail and if the circuit board goes they're expensive. Gledhill used to offer a fixed price repair but not in Essex anymore. The best thing do with this system is rip it out and put a normal unvented cylinder in like we have.</p>
<h2>Benefits of an unvented cylinder, condensing boiler and smart controls</h2>
<h3>Unvented cylinder</h3>
<p>The great thing about unvented cylinders is you have good water pressure from all of your taps (presuming the correct pressure and flow tests have been done on the property prior to the installation)</p>
<p>You have a back up supply of hot water if there is a fault on the boiler, presuming you have a electrical spur and connection to the immersion heater.</p>
<p>You can have a constant supply of hot water, they come in all shapes and sized to suit the property and the needs of the property as with a vented cylinder they're quite limited in their size. I personally run my unvented cylinder on continuous so whenever hot water is used the boiler will quickly heat the cylinder up.</p>
<p>Unvented cylinders are very well insulated so lose very little heat so keeping them heating on a continuous program is the same price as heating it on a timer and you have the added benefit of always having enough hot water.</p>
<h3>Condensing gas boiler</h3>
<p>A condensing boiler saves a lot of money on your gas bills compared to a non-condensing boiler, the main way it does this is by reusing the flue heat. Instead of throwing all of the latent heat into the air it uses the heat to heat the return pipework inside the boiler. To prove the point i've tried putting my hand near the flue of a non-condensing boiler, you can't get near it it's so hot but with a condensing boiler you can easy put your hand and keep it there.</p>
<p>The minimal age for a non-condensing boiler is 18 years old, it's definitely seen better days and it's costing a fortune to run, most boilers we sell come with a 10 year warranty so as long as you keep it serviced that boiler will be worry free for a minimal of 10 years and if looked after such as getting a strip down service every 5 years you could get 15-20 years out of a good quality one such as the ideal logic max.

<p>Super quiet, one of the biggest complements we get about installing a new boiler is how quiet it is, compared to the old one which crashed and banged, you have to open to cupboard to check to see if it's even running or not.</p>
<h3>Smart controls such as hive, nest, tado</h3>
<p>Henry asked us to install a hive as part of the installation, this was nice and simple as all of the old electrics had come out and the only wire I needed to reuse was for the boiler. The new cylinder is what we call a pre plumbed so all the wiring was pre connected into the wiring centre so all that was required from me was a 3 core wire into the wiring centre, 5 core into the hive receiver and then connect the receiver to the cylinder controls, I wish every job was this simple!</p>
<p>Control from the programmer (customer decided to put this onto a stand to keep it mobile) or control from your phone, you can have multiple users but no arguing now, we can help with your heating and hot water needs but domestic arguments is not our forte.</p>
<p>Having the benefit of internet control, a nice bright easy to read display and the fact a smart control will talk efficiently to your new boiler it's a win win and a great investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were contacted by Mrs Woods regarding her old glowworm boiler that had become unreliable, we gave the boiler a diagnostics and found multiple faults on the boiler that was 15 years old. This is the sort of age where a boiler starts to fail and you have to weigh up the options of a repair or replacement because you may repair one or two parts of the boiler but there is nothing to say another part will fail in the near future. The fact there was multiple parts starting to fail and that Mrs Woods was refurbing the whole house now was a perfect time to replace the boiler.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1136" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester.jpg" alt="boiler replacement colchester" width="1080" height="1440" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester.jpg 1080w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester-480x640.jpg 480w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester-992x1323.jpg 992w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/boiler-replacement-Colchester-1024x1365.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<h2>Which combi boiler to go for?</h2>
<p>We spoke about the different options of boiler, all of them were combi boilers but with different warranties. Mrs Woods decided on the ever popular ideal logic max2 with 10 year warranty. This is a great solid boiler which I have in my own home and would replace it with the same boiler when it eventually fails. We upgraded the system controls with nice and simple to use EPH combi pack 4 with big nice visual temperature readings. We install ideal boilers for their reliability, ease of repair and ease of servicing. With regards to servicing most manufactures of  boilers require a strip down service every 5 years, this involves removing the top of the heat exchanger and pouring water through to clear any stuck carbon, the great thing with the logic is when you do this you don't need to replace gaskets etc so works out much cheaper to service than other brands where they require new seals and electrodes &amp; flame rectification probes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Fitting the new boiler</h2>
<p>A straight boiler swap is the most simple type of boiler job we do. The old system was already pressurised for hot water and heating because we were replacing a combi to combi so we knew the old pipework was sound. We drained the old heating down, isolated the mains water supply and safely isolated the electricity supply. When then tested the gas and removed the meter for safety. As you can see from the above picture Rhys hung the old boiler (my old back isn't what it used to be so I avoid the heavy lifting these days) and we started to pipe it up. The ideal logic max2 comes with a brass system filter to collect any sludge in the system. We checked the water quality and it was clean so all that was required was a cold mains flush and a new bottle of inhibitor.</p>

<h3>Registering the new boiler with gas safe</h3>
<p>We commissioned the new boiler and registered with gas safe and ideal. A safety certificate will be delivered within a few days. Nothing will be sent from ideal boilers but it will be on their system and if a warranty call is ever needed please visit this page https://idealheating.com/support/faqs/warranties</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr Chow contacted us regarding a boiler quote in Ipswich. The old Worchester Bosch boiler had been condemned by another heating engineer and had become an uneconomical repair so Mr Chow contacted us regarding a quote. We have a sophisticated quoting system where we didn't even require a site visit, we asked for pictures of the old boiler to be taken and whatsapped or emailed over to us and we managed to build a boiler quote there and then. There were 3 different options for Mr Chow, the budget ideal classic 2 with a 5 year warranty, our popular midrange boiler the ideal logic max2 with 10 year warranty and the top end ideal vogue max with 12 year warranty.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-797" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ideal-logic-max2-combi-.jpg" alt="ideal logic max2 combi" width="900" height="1200" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ideal-logic-max2-combi-.jpg 900w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ideal-logic-max2-combi--480x640.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h2>The ever popular ideal logic max 2 combi boiler with 10 year warranty was chosen.</h2>
<p>Mr Chow opted for the 10 year warranty logic max, this is a no brainer for a landlord as it's good value for money and as long as the boiler is kept serviced every year it's a whole 10 years of worry free from breakdowns because parts and labour are included by manufactures warranty. We carried out a gas safety certificate which is required by landlords when letting a property. The old boiler was taken away for recycling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-799" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10-year-warranty-ideal-logic.jpg" alt="10 year warranty ideal logic" width="900" height="1200" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10-year-warranty-ideal-logic.jpg 900w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/10-year-warranty-ideal-logic-480x640.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>We upgraded the controls to save money on heating bills</h2>
<p>We installed the budget wireless programmer that is really good value for money. If the client decides they don't require a wifi internet enabled thermostat our goto wireless programmer without internet is the EPH. Great little programmer with really easy to use bright interface. The bonus of using this smart programmer is it can communicate with the boiler with opentherm technology meaning it can save even more gas and protects the components from constantly being turned on and off like a traditional programmer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-801" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/wireless-programmer.jpg" alt="wireless programmer" width="900" height="1200" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/wireless-programmer.jpg 900w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/wireless-programmer-480x640.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3>  We installed a magnetic system filter to protect the boiler.</h3>
<p>With the logic and vogue max of boilers a magnetic filter is included in the box. In my opinion this is the best magnetic filter on the market, it's fully brass and will last forever as it doesn't require the top to be unscrewed to remove the magnet, neither do the isolation valves need to be touched, two of the things that fail on most other filters. The magnet is really strong too protecting the boiler from any sludge floating around the system. We do a chemical flush on any new system as a minimal but with very old and poorly looked after systems a magnaclense or <span style="color: #0000ff;">powerflush maybe required.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-802" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/inhibitor-fernox-top-up.jpg" alt="inhibitor fernox top up" width="900" height="1200" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/inhibitor-fernox-top-up.jpg 900w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/inhibitor-fernox-top-up-480x640.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3>Which central heating chemicals do we use?</h3>
<p>We only use the best chemicals on the market whether that be for powerflushing or just general chemicals such as inhibitor it's never a good idea to save money on these as these are the things that will save you money by preventing your heating system breaking down. Our goto inhibitor is the fernox concentrate, the reason for this is fernox have always been a industry leader in this field (the guys actually invented and most people refer to inhibitor as fernox) and because it's a concentrate in a small bottle it fits perfectly into the fernox omega filter that is supplied with the boiler so it's a win win, the best chemical on the market and it fills the system easily via the filter.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803" src="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ideal-logic-filter.jpg" alt="ideal logic filter" width="900" height="1200" srcset="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ideal-logic-filter.jpg 900w, https://elementisboilerexperts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ideal-logic-filter-480x640.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>

<h2 class="p1">A well needed upgrade from a gas guzzling back boiler with pilot light to an energy efficient ideal logic heat only boiler</h2>
<p class="p2">We visited Ashley Page in Colchester because he wanted to lower his rising gas bills and wanted to install a wood burner in place of the back boiler. The old back boiler that was at the property was well over 30 years old. The problem with such boilers is they cost an absolute fortune to run, proof of this is testing the flue temperature, it will be in excess of 160 oC where as a new boiler it will be around the 60 oC mark. The reason is old boilers like this are non-condensing, if your boiler is around 18 years old plus and doesn't have a white 22mm pipe coming from it will be a non condensing type.</p>
<p class="p2">One other main reason to upgrade is most parts for these old boilers are obsolete so if you were very unlucky and it broke down during the winter you will probably need to have it replaced, this would be a much better idea to do in the summer because it could be a planned repair and not having to wait days for a new installation at peak time.</p>
<p class="p2">The reason condensing boilers are much more efficient is because they reuse the flue gases to heat the return water coming back to the boiler, otherwise this is just wasted heat. All boilers sold in the UK now have to be of the condensing kind.</p>
<p class="p2">When removing old back boilers we offer to remove the whole unit or leave just the front fire working if possible. On this occasion we disconnected all of the pipework because the customer wanted to use a solid fuel burner in the future, in this case we left the fire in place until time was right to purchase the solid fuel burner.</p>
<h3 class="p1">What was the equipment that we installed for the boiler installation?</h3>
<p class="p2">We decided to install the ideal logic MAX Heat only 18KW boiler with a 10 year warranty. The customer wanted to relocate the boiler into the loft, this is fine but it causes one issue, the header tank that fills the heating system is located in the loft (on most occasions) and this uses gravity. The boiler cannot be at the same height or only slight higher as you will get air locks. There is two ways around this, raise the header tank so it has more head height/pressure, this is never perfect so we opted to convert the heating to a pressurised system.</p>
<p class="p2">We did this by bringing a mains water pipe up to the boiler and installed an expansion vessel next to the boiler. When doing this type of system in a loft we ALWAYS bring pipework back down to the airing cupboard with a filling loop and pressure gauge so if the system ever needed topping up it can be done without climbing into a loft.</p>
<h2 class="p1">The re run of the gas pipework for the central heating</h2>
<h3 class="p1">The thought process for the gas run</h3>
<p class="p2">We had to run new 22mm gas pipework from the front of the house around to the side and up into the roof space. This took quite a bit of planning as we figured out the most economical run but also being pleasing on the eye. We calculated the size of the pipework over the distance required.</p>
<h3 class="p4">Installing the gas boiler into the loft space</h3>
<p class="p2">Compared the old back boiler which used a chimney stack to remove it's products of combustion and pulled fresh air from the room, this the reason rooms where the back boiler is located are quite cold as they need to have a constant flow of fresh air from a vent to outside for it to run safely.</p>
<p class="p2">The great thing about modern boilers is the flue has two parts, the outside part which pulls fresh in and outside part which blows out the products of combustion. These are called room sealed boilers and even if the boiler had produced a fault and was burning un safe the products of combustion would always go outside not causing any harm to the household. The way to tell from outside would be a very gassy mix of condensate which would be easy to smell.

<h3 class="p1">The installation of the new boiler</h3>
<p class="p2">As you can see, even tho this pipework will be covered with lagging we still try and install it as neatly as possible. We have installed two automatic air vents as air will naturally rise, at the top of the boiler will be a prime place for air to get trapped causing air locks. This is also another really important reason we install a filling loop in the airing cupboard because normally for the first couple weeks bits of trapped air that are impossible to remove at first will always find their way to the highest point in the central heating system which in this case is the loft space. The automatic air valves will open to allow the air out and keep the water in but will drop the pressure meaning it will need topping up, this usually settles in a day or two but may take a couple weeks.</p>

<h3 class="p2">The finished boiler in Colchester</h3>
<p class="p2">Here you can see all of the pipework is neatly lagged to protect from frost. We commissioned the boiler and registered the warranty with ideal boilers. We then registered the installation with gas safe register, make sure when you get your boiler installed or anything gas related please check your engineers gas safe card to check online to see if they are legitimate as there are illegal engineers out there so be careful.</p>
<p class="p2">We explained how the boiler works, where and how to use the filling loop located in the airing cupboard. We removed all rubbish from site and left everything as clean as it was before we got there.</p>
<p class="p2">The customer was impressed with our booking system where the boiler quote was booked via our link <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://elementisboilerexperts.com/new-boiler-buying-guide/"><span class="s1">https://elementisboilerexperts.com/boiler-installation/</span></a></span> where a date and time was selected by the client.</p>
<p class="p2">Then a confirmation text and email was sent out that the date and time selected was in the diary. 24 hours before the appointment a reminder is sent out that we will be with you tomorrow.</p>
<p class="p2">On the day of the appointment we will notify you when we leave the previous job with an exact arrival time, we give a rough time on the confirmation but as with the nature of the beast some jobs over run but we will always message to let you know the engineer is running late.</p>
<p class="p2">You can then track the van on the way to your house once we notify you we have left the previous job.</p>
