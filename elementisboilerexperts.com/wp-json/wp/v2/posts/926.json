If you keep up to date with servicing your boiler, you can avoid replacing it for longer. But the time inevitably will come when regular checks and repairs won\u2019t cut it anymore. Your boiler has reached the end of its life and needs to be put out to pasture.<\/h3>\n<p>So, when should you replace your boiler? Read on for signs that the time has come.<\/p>\n<h2>When does regular servicing reach its limit?<\/h2>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.worcester-bosch.co.uk\/about\/news\/feeling-the-heat-is-the-trusty-boiler-britains-most-loved-appliance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Worcester Borsch survey<\/a>, the vast majority of UK homeowners (92%) are aware of just how much their daily lives would be affected if their boiler broke down. So, it stands to reason that <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-service\/\">regular servicing<\/a> of your heating system is a good habit to get into.<\/p>\n<p>Problems can be discovered and nipped in the bud early. Costs are reduced if smaller repairs are carried out when needed, as opposed to waiting for a huge breakdown and a massive repair bill \u2013 or needing frequent emergency repairs.<\/p>\n<p>But even servicing won\u2019t make your boiler last forever. Listen to your heating engineer when your boiler is annually serviced. If you use a reputable company, they will be able to advise you how much longer your boiler will be serviceable. They are also able to let you know when it is time to bite the bullet and replace it.<\/p>\n<h2>How often should I replace my boiler?<\/h2>\n<p>Even if your boiler still seems to be working fine, it is a good idea to <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/new-boiler\/\">replace your boiler<\/a> every 10-15 years. If you have been getting regular boiler servicing, you are likely to get more out of it for longer. But you might want to consider replacing it before it breaks down.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to notice any changes in your heating or water to consider a newer model. \u00a0Today\u2019s boilers are much more energy-efficient than older models. A huge benefit in updating your boiler now means savings on your bills and reducing your carbon footprint at the same time.<\/p>\n<h2>Signs that it\u2019s time for a new boiler<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Constant breakdowns<\/strong> \u2013 If your boiler is ignoring the thermostat, the circulator pump is failing (no water pressure) and limescale and mineral build up (kittling) is happening \u2013 it\u2019s time to consider replacing your boiler.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Loud noises<\/strong> \u2013 There may be excess air in the system, pump failure (a banging noise) or a faulty thermostat (a humming sound). Remember, a noisy boiler means a broken one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Poor performance<\/strong> \u2013 For example, low water pressure, pilot light going out regularly, radiators lukewarm or not getting hot at all and the boiler switching itself off \u2013 all are clear signs that your boiler\u2019s performance is decreasing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Recurring repairs<\/strong> \u2013 Having to call an engineer frequently for repairs. A blocked flue, faulty thermostat or leaks caused by a corroded pressure valve are signals that you need a new boiler installed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Quality boiler replacement with Elementis<\/h2>\n<p>If you have been busy googling \u201cshould I replace my boiler?\u201d recently, don\u2019t worry. <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/\">Elementis Boiler Experts<\/a> are on hand to guide you through the process and provide a professional service.<\/p>\n<p>Our team of expert engineers have vast experience in <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-installation\/\">boiler installations<\/a>.
