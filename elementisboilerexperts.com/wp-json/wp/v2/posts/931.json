A boiler warranty is a guarantee from the manufacturer that their product is of good quality and will function as intended. But what does a boiler warranty cover, and how long does it last?<\/p>\n<h2>How long does a boiler warranty last?<\/h2>\n<p>Most boilers come with a warranty that lasts between 2-12 years, depending on the manufacturer and the type of boiler. This warranty covers the cost of any repairs that need to be made to the boiler within the warranty period, as long as the issue is not caused by user error or lack of maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>The exact details of what is covered by a boiler warranty can vary depending on the manufacturer, so it's important to read the terms and conditions carefully. However, most boiler warranties cover the following:<\/p>\n<h2>Here is what is included in your boiler warranty;<\/h2>\n<h3>Parts and labour<\/h3>\n<p>The cost of any replacement parts and the labour required to install them is usually covered by the warranty.<\/p>\n<h3>Faults and defects<\/h3>\n<p>If the boiler develops a fault or defect within the warranty period, the cost of repairs or replacement is typically covered.<\/p>\n<h3>Heat Exchanger<\/h3>\n<p>The heat exchanger is the part of the boiler that heats the water, and it is often covered under the warranty for a specific period of time.<\/p>\n<h3>Guarantee of workmanship<\/h3>\n<p>Some warranties also include a guarantee of workmanship, meaning that if the installation is not done correctly, the manufacturer will cover the cost of any necessary repairs.<\/p>\n<h3>Extended warranty<\/h3>\n<p>Some manufacturers offer an extended warranty for an additional fee, which can provide additional coverage beyond the standard warranty period.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here is a list of the warranties we offer<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-939\" src=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/ideal-logic-warranty.png\" alt=\"ideal logic warranty\" width=\"1131\" height=\"1504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/ideal-logic-warranty.png 1131w, https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/ideal-logic-warranty-480x638.png 480w, https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/ideal-logic-warranty-992x1319.png 992w, https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/ideal-logic-warranty-1024x1362.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1131px) 100vw, 1131px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It's important to note that a boiler warranty will not cover damage caused by user error or lack of maintenance. For example, if the boiler breaks down due to a build-up of limescale, this may not be covered by the warranty if the boiler has not been <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">properly maintained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In addition, many manufacturers require that the boiler is installed and serviced by a qualified heating engineer in order to maintain the warranty. Failure to do so could result in the warranty being voided.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>In conclusion, a boiler warranty is an important consideration when purchasing a new boiler. It can provide peace of mind that your boiler is covered in the event of any issues, and can help to reduce the cost of any necessary repairs. However, it's important to read the terms and conditions carefully and ensure that you properly maintain your boiler in order to maintain the warranty.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>The highest warranty we offer is the ideal vogue max, to book a quote visit <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/new-boiler\/\">New Boiler<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"flex justify-between lg:block\">\n<div class=\"text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-941\" src=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/what-is-a-boiler-warranty.png\" alt=\"what is a boiler warranty\" width=\"421\" height=\"424\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you're thinking of purchasing a new boiler, one of the things you'll want to consider is the warranty.
