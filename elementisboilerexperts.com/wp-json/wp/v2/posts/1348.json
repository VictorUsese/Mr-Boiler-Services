Basically they were invented so you could have independent control over your heating and hotwater, if you choose hot water the valve for it will automatically open and the heating will stay closed and vise versa or they can both be on at the same time. This wasn't a thing before and we kind of take it for granted but it's a great invention as you are only heating what you need, either heating or hotwater.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway we always keep a stock on the van of common central heating parts such as 2 ports, 2 port heads, programmers, central heating pumps, 3 ports etc.<\/p>\n<p>If you require a visit from one of our qualified gas safe engineers based in Colchester please <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-repair-colchester\/\">visit this page\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I know, it doesn't get much more exciting than talking about 2 port valve heads but try and calm yourself before this gets out of control... but what on earth has happened to Honeywell 2 ports??
