But they should, for several reasons. In this post, we\u2019ll outline how often you should get your boiler serviced and why it\u2019s both important and beneficial to do so!<\/p>\n<h2>How often should a boiler be serviced?<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ll keep this short and simple \u2013 you should get your boiler serviced once a year to keep it in tip top condition. Any less, and you\u2019ll be allowing more time for issues to develop which could cost more to repair. Any more, and you\u2019ll be paying out unnecessarily.<\/p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-service\/\">annual boiler service<\/a> provides the perfect balance between safety, efficiency, practicality and cost. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the standard frequency recommended by the vast majority of boiler manufacturers when new units are installed.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there will be plenty of people out there who think that they can get away with doing it less often and getting away with it. Below are some of the reasons why that\u2019s not advisable\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>Keeping your warranty intact<\/h3>\n<p>The most obvious reason why you should get your boiler serviced annually is that it keeps the warranty intact. Most new boilers come with a manufacturer\u2019s warranty of 5-10 years. That means the manufacturer will repair or replace the boiler if any problems develop in the first few years.<\/p>\n<p>But that only applies if you keep your side of the bargain. Getting your boiler serviced often enough (once a year) shows that you\u2019ve taken reasonable care, so any issues that arise aren\u2019t simply due to negligence.<\/p>\n<h3>Safety first<\/h3>\n<p>However, the most important reason is your own safety. With the risk of gas leaks or even an explosion, boilers aren\u2019t something you want to take chances with. Knowing how often your boiler should be serviced will keep you and your family safe.<\/p>\n<h3>Extending your boiler\u2019s lifespan<\/h3>\n<p>Having your boiler serviced annually allows professionals to spot small issues and stop them causing damage to your heating system. For example, a small build up of sludge can easily be remedied before it causes clogs and damages boiler parts. In turn, this will increase your boiler\u2019s lifespan, giving you more years back from your initial investment.<\/p>\n<h3>Saving money on repairs<\/h3>\n<p>The proactive approach outlined above will also save you money. A boiler service costs around \u00a3100 each year, which is less than even the smallest part replacement on your boiler. While avoiding the service might save you money up front, it could cost a lot more in the long run.<\/p>\n<h3>And on your bills!<\/h3>\n<p>Regular boiler servicing also makes sure that your boiler is operating efficiently. That means \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 more cost savings. With energy prices at an all-time high, it\u2019s never been more important to make sure your boiler is using as little energy as possible to provide hot water and heat to your home.<\/p>\n<h3>Minimising disruption<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, knowing how often you should get your boiler serviced allows you to minimise disruption for your home. Your annual service will be much easier to fit into your schedule than extensive repairs or even a replacement \u2013 not to mention days without heating or hot water.<\/p>\n<h2>Get your boiler serviced for safety and efficiency<\/h2>\n<p>The case is clear \u2013 an annual <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-service\/\">boiler service<\/a> will keep you safe, save you money and make your life easier.
