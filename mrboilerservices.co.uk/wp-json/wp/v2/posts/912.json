However, like any mechanical system, they will eventually wear out and need to be replaced. If you're wondering how long your boiler will last, there are a few factors to consider.<\/p>\n<h2>The life span of a boiler<\/h2>\n<p>The lifespan of a boiler depends on a number of variables, including the quality of the original installation, how well it has been maintained, and the type of fuel it uses. However, on average, a well-maintained boiler can last between 10-15 years, with some lasting as long as 20 years or more.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important factors in determining the lifespan of a boiler is how well it has been maintained. Regular servicing and maintenance by a qualified heating engineer can help to keep your boiler in good condition, identifying and resolving any issues before they cause serious damage. This can help to extend the lifespan of your boiler and ensure that it continues to operate efficiently.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-918\" src=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/how-long-should-a-boiler-last.png\" alt=\"how long should a boiler last\" width=\"999\" height=\"610\" srcset=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/how-long-should-a-boiler-last.png 999w, https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/how-long-should-a-boiler-last-480x293.png 480w, https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/how-long-should-a-boiler-last-992x606.png 992w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Quality of Installation is important<\/h3>\n<p>Another factor to consider is the quality of the original installation. A properly installed boiler, with all the correct fittings and pipework, is more likely to last longer than one that has been poorly installed or doesn't match the needs of the property it is serving. If you're having a new boiler installed, it's important to choose a reputable installer with a track record of quality workmanship.<\/p>\n<h3>Type of fuel makes a difference, gas, oil and electric<\/h3>\n<p>The type of fuel your boiler uses can also impact its lifespan. Gas boilers, for example, tend to last longer than oil boilers, due to the fact that gas is a cleaner fuel and causes less wear and tear on the system. Electric boilers, on the other hand, can last even longer, as they have fewer moving parts and are less prone to corrosion.<\/p>\n<h3>Another great reason to keep your boiler serviced<\/h3>\n<p>In addition to regular servicing and maintenance, there are a few things you can do to help prolong the lifespan of your boiler. For example, ensuring that your boiler is regularly cleaned, that the pressure is at the correct level, and that the radiators are bled when necessary can all help to keep your system running smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>If you're wondering whether it's time to replace your boiler, there are a few signs to look out for. These include unusual noises, leaks, a drop in efficiency, and a sudden increase in your energy bills. If you notice any of these issues, it's best to consult with a qualified heating engineer, who can advise you on whether repairs or replacement are the best option.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, the lifespan of a boiler can vary depending on a number of factors. However, with regular maintenance and proper care, you can help to ensure that your boiler lasts as long as possible, providing you with warmth and hot water for many years to come.<\/p>\n<p>Too book a service please visit <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-service\/\">here<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Or if you think it's time for a new one visit <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/new-boiler\/\">here<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Did you know we do service plans? visit <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-service-plans\/\">here<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Boilers are an essential part of many homes, providing warmth and hot water for daily use.
