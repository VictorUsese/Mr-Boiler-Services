It heats your rooms on cold nights and warms up the water when you need a quick shower. But if something goes wrong, it can quickly become costly.<\/h3>\n<p>When your boiler needs replacing, repairing or servicing, you need to be sure you\u2019re getting a good deal. That\u2019s where boiler quotes come in...<\/p>\n<h2>What are boiler quotes?<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re shopping around for <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-installation\/\">boiler installation<\/a> or repairs, the companies you contact will provide you with boiler quotes. Put simply, they will give you a clear overview of the costs you\u2019ll need to pay, including parts and labour. This information can help you to weigh up who is offering the best deal before you hire someone.<\/p>\n<h2>When do I need boiler quotes?<\/h2>\n<p>There are several different scenarios that will usually require you to ask for some boiler quotes.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacing or installing a boiler<\/strong> \u2013 You\u2019ll need a quote for replacing a boiler or installing one into a new property.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Repairs<\/strong> \u2013 Any repairs will require quotes, though some repairs may be covered by a servicing or maintenance plan.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Servicing<\/strong> \u2013 It\u2019s recommended that you service your boiler each year to ensure it\u2019s in good working order. You can get quotes for a one-off service or a boiler service plan.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>How the process works<\/h2>\n<p>Obtaining boiler quotes is a very simple process. First, you\u2019ll need to reach out to a few heating engineers and tell them about the issue, along with details of your heating and hot water requirements.<\/p>\n<p>You may be able to get an online boiler quote, but in most cases, the engineer will need to visit your home first. They\u2019ll find the best solution for you \u2013 and if they offer energy saving features, such as smart thermostats, they\u2019ll be able to talk you through these too.<\/p>\n<h2>How many boiler quotes should I get?<\/h2>\n<p>Generally speaking, you should contact at least two or three installers\/engineers. Don\u2019t just go with the first quote you get.<\/p>\n<p>Some factors to consider include...<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are they local enough to you for a quick response?<\/li>\n<li>Do they have the full accreditations required for the job?<\/li>\n<li>Do online reviews recommend their services?<\/li>\n<li>Do they listen to your needs and requirements?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What should a boiler quote include?<\/h2>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got all your boiler quotes, you might still be unsure about what you\u2019re actually looking for. The main consideration is usually the price. Make sure they\u2019ve provided a detailed breakdown of the costs. Providing only the total price gives you no indication of what exactly you\u2019re paying for \u2013 which isn\u2019t good practice on their part.<\/p>\n<p>A detailed cost breakdown also enables you to compare engineers. Whilst one boiler installer might be more expensive, they could offer considerably more than the others within that price.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you\u2019ll be looking for different things in an installation quote to a servicing quote. For example, you\u2019ll need to keep an eye out for any guarantees or warranties in an installation quote, whereas the option for a <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-service-plans\/\">boiler service plan<\/a> is a consideration for servicing quotes.<\/p>\n<h2>Request a boiler quote today<\/h2>\n<p>With a myriad of energy-saving benefits, it\u2019s no wonder that many homeowners are taking the plunge and installing a new boiler.<\/p>\n<p>At Elementis, our gas safe registered boiler experts have over 15 years\u2019 experience installing, repairing and servicing boilers across the Essex area.
