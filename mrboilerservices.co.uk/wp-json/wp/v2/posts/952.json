That shows just how important a good, working boiler is for your home and your pocket.<\/h3>\n<p>But old boilers aren\u2019t just inefficient. Over time, the constant cycle of breakdowns and repairs can become tiresome and costly. Surely there\u2019s a better way? This post will outline six benefits of a new boiler over yet another repair job.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Energy efficient<\/h2>\n<p>Many boilers aren\u2019t as efficient as they used to be and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homelogic.co.uk\/how-much-heat-is-lost-through-the-roof\">waste around 25%<\/a> of their heat. The older they get, the more likely leaks or faults will develop. You could end up on a constant loop of boiler repairs. With rising energy prices, that could mean losing hundreds of pounds unnecessarily.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/new-boiler\/\">New boilers<\/a> have an A-rating for energy, which means they are at least 90% efficient. They use the more of the heat generated to do what they\u2019re supposed to, making them more economical to run.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Cost-effective<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to new boilers, most people focus on the outgoing investment. But don\u2019t forget the savings you\u2019ll make over time. According to the Energy Saving Trust, you can save <a href=\"https:\/\/energysavingtrust.org.uk\/advice\/boilers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">up to \u00a3840 per year<\/a> by replacing an old boiler with an A-rated model, depending on the rating of the existing boiler and the type of house it\u2019s heating.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Precise heating control<\/h2>\n<p>Room thermostats are standard on every new boiler, which gives you control over the temperature in each room of the house. So, there is no need to waste energy by heating empty rooms. This provides two new boiler benefits, as it will help lower monthly costs and keep everyone more comfortable.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Ongoing service plans<\/h2>\n<p>Many people wait until their boiler needs repairs before they contact an engineer. But a huge new boiler benefit is that you don\u2019t have to worry about costs or the hassle of sourcing a professional. Many companies offer an <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/boiler-service-plan\">ongoing service plan<\/a> that gives you annual checks on your heating system by a certified engineer. So, you have peace of mind that you aren\u2019t likely to be hit with huge repair bills, as well as knowing your boiler is safe for use.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Peace and quiet<\/h2>\n<p>Gone are the days where your boiler is grumbling loudly from its storage cupboard. A new modern boiler won\u2019t be noisy due to years of use, so it won\u2019t keep you awake at night or gurgle in the background when you have visitors.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Choose which suits your lifestyle<\/h2>\n<p>A major benefit of a new boiler is that you can choose which type will work for you. The three main types of boilers are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Combi boilers \u2013 <\/strong>Systems that combine a water heater and boiler together. Providing hot water on demand, they are popular due to their compact size \u2013 perfect for smaller homes with limited space.<\/li>\n<li><strong>System boilers \u2013<\/strong> A tank or cylinder that heats the water before sending it out to radiators and taps in the home. Bigger homes with more than one bathroom prefer a system boiler as it caters for a higher demand of heating and hot water.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Heat only boilers<\/strong> \u2013 Also called a \u2018conventional\u2019 boiler, it is used in bigger homes or older properties that need their system replaced. They use a separate hot water cylinder and a cold-water storage tank.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Try these new boiler benefits for yourself<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to enjoy the benefits of a new boiler, <a href=\"https:\/\/elementisboilerexperts.com\/\">Elementis Boiler Experts<\/a> are here to help in Essex.
